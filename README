parse-number-range parses LOOP's convenient "for-as-arithmetic" syntax
into 5 simple values: from, to, limit-kind (:inclusive, :exclusive or
nil if unbounded), by (step) and direction (+ or -)). Further related
utilities are provided. Intended for easy implementation of analogous
functionality in other constructs.
